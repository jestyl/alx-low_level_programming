Tasks

0-holberton.c

title: _putchar
For this task we have to write a program that print Holberton, followed by a new line, using _putchar().
This first task is also use to check if we added int _putchar(char c); correctly to the holberton.h file.



1-alphabet.c

title: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
For this task create a function that print the alphabet on a line + newline after as well as have to add the prototype: void print_alphabet(void); to my holberton.h file. I'm also barred from using standard libs, only _putchar()

_putchar() only.



2-print_alphabet_x10.c

title: 10 x alphabet
Simalar from prior task create a function that print the alphabet on a line + newline 10 times as well as add the prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void); to my holberton.h file.

_putchar() only.



3-islower.c

title: 0. _islower
I have to write a function–_islower–that perform the same fuctions as one shipped with "C" islower().

add to holberton.h

Returns 1 is c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise



4-isalpha.c

title: isalpha
I need to recreate a function–_isalpha()–that perform that same job as shipped one isalpha()

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);

Returns 1 if cis a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise



5-sign

title: 5-sign
Have to create is function that prints the sign +/- of a given number or "Zero".

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero5-sign



6-abs.c

title: There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Have to create a function–_abs()– that performan the same task as abs().

add prototype to holberton.h



7-print_last_digit.c

title: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Have to create a function–print_last_digit(int)– that print and also return the last digit.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int); add to holberton.h

Return that last digit.



8-24_hours.c

title: I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Have to write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
